AdFreeBut480pForTwitch

This extension will make Twitch videos ad-free, however the quality will only go to 480p max.

This is all done locally, so no VPN's, Proxies or third party websites.

You must remove any Twitch related userscripts or other Twitch specific ad block extensions to prevent conflicts. You can use this extension with uBlock Origin though (Without user-scripts installed).

If you have issues while using this extension, please note, some ad-blocker extensions may interfere with this extension.
